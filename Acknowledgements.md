I am not the smartest cookie, so here are some sources I've used to help me on this project:

- [OSDev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/)
- [MellOS](https://github.com/mell-o-tron/MellOs)
  - I contribute here and I've learnt a lot from these guys.
- [janaSunrise](https://github.com/janaSunrise/rust-64-bit-os/blob/main/src/gdt.rs)
  - I basically stole your GDT, but thank you
