I am not the smartest cookie, so here are some sources I've used to help me on this project:

- [OSDev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/)
- [MellOS](https://github.com/mell-o-tron/MellOs)
  - I contribute here and I've learnt a lot from these guys.
- [Steve Klabnik](https://github.com/steveklabnik)
  - Who's book [here](https://intermezzos.github.io/book/first-edition/preface.html) really helped get things off the ground.
- [janaSunrise](https://github.com/janaSunrise/rust-64-bit-os/blob/main/src/gdt.rs)
